## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type - use specific types
- Use type-only imports when appropriate: `import type { ... }`

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the existing design system
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Maintain RTL (right-to-left) support for Hebrew

### Code Style

- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, please test:

- [ ] All existing functionality still works
- [ ] New features work as expected
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Hebrew text displays correctly
- [ ] PDF export works properly

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Photo upload and collage generation
- [ ] Personal dates management
- [ ] Customization options
- [ ] PDF export functionality
- [ ] Local storage persistence
- [ ] Hebrew calendar integration

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document component props and interfaces
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Keep inline comments concise and helpful

### User Documentation

- Update user-facing documentation
- Add screenshots for new features
- Maintain Hebrew and English documentation
- Keep installation instructions current

## Internationalization

### Hebrew Support

- All user-facing text should be in Hebrew
- Maintain RTL (right-to-left) layout support
- Use proper Hebrew fonts (Noto Sans Hebrew)
- Test Hebrew text rendering and layout

### Adding New Languages

If you want to add support for new languages:

1. Create a new language file in `src/locales/`
2. Update the language switcher component
3. Test RTL support if applicable
4. Update documentation

## Performance Considerations

### Image Processing

- Optimize image compression and resizing
- Implement proper memory management
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations if needed
- Cache processed images when possible

### PDF Generation

- Optimize PDF generation performance
- Implement progress indicators for long operations
- Handle large numbers of photos efficiently
- Provide fallbacks for memory constraints

## Security

### Data Privacy

- All data is stored locally in the browser
- No data is sent to external servers (except Hebcal API)
- Implement proper input validation
- Sanitize user inputs

### File Handling

- Validate file types and sizes
- Implement proper error handling
- Prevent XSS attacks in user inputs
- Use secure file processing methods
